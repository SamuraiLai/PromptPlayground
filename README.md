# PromptPlayground
Powerful, sticky “prompt‑engineering games” sit where four disciplines overlap: state‑of‑the‑art AI capability, lean prompt techniques, dopamine‑tuned game loops, and evidence‑based learning science.


# 🎮 Prompt Playground

**Learn to think clearer and prompt better — one game at a time.**  
_A retro-style playground for mastering prompt engineering through fun, fast, skill-building mini-games._

## 🚀 What is Prompt Playground?

**Prompt Playground** is an open-source platform for teaching **prompt engineering** through interactive, dopamine-smart mini-games.  
We blend best practices from:

- 🧠 **Cognitive science** (spaced repetition, scaffolding, ZPD)
- 🤖 **AI alignment and LLM usage** (CoT, persona prompts, constraints)
- 🕹 **Game design** (variable reward loops, adaptive difficulty)

> Inspired by Ken Liu’s vision of AI as a new artistic medium.

## 🎯 Who is it for?

- Power LLM users who want to level up
- Teachers introducing AI literacy in schools
- Developers, designers, and lifelong learners
